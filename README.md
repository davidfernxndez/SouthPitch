# SouthPitch
SouthPitch is the pitch correction system developed as a final project for the degree in Telecommunications Engineering by David Fernández Martínez. 

In this repository you will find the installer of the developed application together with the user manual in pdf. In addition, a folder is added in 
which there are acapella voice signals with their corresponding musical scale, these audios can be used to test the system.


The code for this implementation can be found in the https://github.com/davidfernxndez/pitch-correction-system repository in my profile.
